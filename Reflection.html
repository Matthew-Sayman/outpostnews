				<p>The pandemic has been going on for almost 3 years now. There have been many developed vaccines that have already been distributed throughout the world. 
					However, we are still not allowed to freely roam around for there is still a risk of infection. The COVID-19 cases are still rising and there are still many people who succumb to the disease every day.
					 So, for all that is good, we must be patient until all of this is over.</p>

				<p>During the past 2 years in quarantine, I have been able to learn new things about myself that I haven't before. I have also gotten to know more about my family and have gotten closer to them. I have been also able to acquire new skills which would benefit me later on. 
					Most importantly, the quarantine taught me patience. It is safe to say that I learned many things during this experience and I believe people should take this opportunity to do the same.
