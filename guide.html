            <p>Ever felt that you've done practically everything that you can think in the top of your head during the lockdown? Well, I have too, so here are my
                recommendations on what to do to make it much more lively and more interesting rather than making your life much more harder and boring and pretty much plain 
                at this point.</p>

        <div class="second_paragraph">
            <p>Of course, this are my picks on how-not-to get bored during the pandemic lockdown. If something does not fit your style in killing down time, then find a way. 
                But if something here sparks your brain or catches your attention then feel free to try it out yourselves. Again, this is only a matter of choice, no need to 
                force yourself to do it.

            <h3>1. Find an exercise routine that suits you the best.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content_one">
            <p>Finding an exercise that fits you the best is possibly the best tip you can ever find. Rather than searching a routine of a fit guy on the internet might be another option, most certainly it won't help you in the long run.

            <h3>2. Find games that happens to fit what you like instead of sticking to one.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content_two">
            <p>Finding a game or videogame that makes you happy will make your lockdown life much more easier than what it is now. For example, playing different genres of games
                like 'The Game of Life' or 'Uno with Friends' can make your vision of games much more wider. Of course there are some much more harder games and also different story-campaign games,
                just like the Call of Duty franchise which has a campaign option or rhythm games such as osu! which will make you get out of your comfort zone and make you much more competitive.

        <div class="title_three">
            <h3>3. Explore more genres of different forms of entertainment.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content_three">
            <p>Get out of your comfort zone and do some research and explore more genres rather than sticking to one. Take it as an example, Anime. Anime has a wide variety of genres and topics that you
                can filter out to find out what series or movie you want to watch. It could be a shounen (action-filled plots) anime, or take it much more simpler, the rom-com side of the anime category.
                Now this doesn't just stop at anime, this also applies to music and movies. So don't worry about now finding what kind of entertainment you can't watch because there is a ton of it floating across the internet.

            <h3>4.Learn something, Educate yourself more.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content_last">
            <p>For this last pick, I think learning different cultures of different countries can be a way to kill your boredom in some other way. Like learning their languange, culture and stuff that makes that country
                much more unique than yours. This can increase your not just your communication skills, but also makes you understand people on what they are talking about. But if learning a language doesn't tickle your fancy,
                then I'd suggest going to Duolingo and start talking with an imaginary bird making sure you can learn the languange very well.
